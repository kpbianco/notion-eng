# Artifact 28 — Prototyping & Bring-Up Plan

**What this is**

A short, sequenced plan to bring the system to life safely.

**Artifacts**

- Bring-Up Checklist
- Bench Test Scripts/Procedures

**How to build**

1. Create **Bring-Up Checklist**:
    
    ```
    Power-only sanity → interfaces loopback → minimal functionality → full path
    For each step: instrumentation, expected readings, safe limits, stop criteria
    
    ```
    
2. Attach **scripts/procedures** (e.g., smoke test, loopbacks, sample I/O).

**Quality check**

- Each step has clear **pass/fail** and safe abort criteria.
