# Artifact 34 — Safety, Compliance & Ethics

**What this is**

Hazard analysis, applicable standards, and how you meet them.

**Artifacts**

- Standards Matrix
- Hazard Analysis (PHA/FMEA linkage)
- Safety Instructions/Labels
- Ethics checklist (data use, consent, bias)

**How to build**

1. **Standards Matrix**: Standard → Clause → Applicability → Evidence (doc/test) → Status.
2. **Hazard Analysis** page:
    - Identify hazards, causes, severities, mitigations, residual risk acceptance.
3. Draft **safety instructions** (install/use warnings), and **ethics checklist** for data handling.

**Quality check**

- Each applicable clause has **evidence** and status (pass/pending).
