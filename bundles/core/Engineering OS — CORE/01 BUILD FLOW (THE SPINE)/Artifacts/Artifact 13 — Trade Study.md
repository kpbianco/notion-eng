# Artifact 13 — Trade Study

**What this is**

A structured way to pick among alternatives.

**Artifacts**

- Trade Matrix
- Decision Record

**How to build**

1. Notion table “Trade Study” with columns:
    - Option, Criteria_1 Score, …, Criteria_N Score, Weighted Total, Notes.
2. First, define **criteria and weights** in a small table:
    - Criteria, Weight (0–1), Why it matters.
3. Score each option 1–5 per criterion, compute **Weighted Total** (Notion formula).
4. Add **Sensitivity** note (what if weights shift? does winner change?).

**Quality check**

- A skeptic agrees the winner is reasonable given weights and notes.
