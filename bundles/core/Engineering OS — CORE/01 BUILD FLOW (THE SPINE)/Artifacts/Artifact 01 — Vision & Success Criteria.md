# Artifact 01 — Vision & Success Criteria

Here’s your **Notion-ready, step-by-step “how to build every artifact” guide for Items 1–20**. It’s written so a motivated beginner can follow it without prior process knowledge. Copy-paste into Notion; each section can be its own page or a single long page with toggles.

**What this is**

A one-page statement of *why* the project exists and *what “done” means* in measurable terms.

**Artifacts to produce**

- Vision Statement
- Success Metrics list

**How to build (step-by-step)**

1. Open a new Notion page “Vision & Success”.
2. Paste this template and fill it in **plain language** (no tech jargon):
    
    ```
    ## Vision Statement
    **Problem:** <What pain exists today?>
    **Desired Outcome:** <What will be true when the project succeeds?>
    **Who Benefits:** <Primary user/customer>
    **Definition of Success:** <1–3 sentences that a non-engineer can verify>
    
    ## Success Metrics
    - S1: <Metric name>: <target number> by <date or condition>
    - S2: ...
    - S3: ...
    
    ```
    
3. Translate “Definition of Success” into **3–7 numeric metrics** (update rate ≥ X, time ≤ Y, cost ≤ Z, satisfaction ≥ N%).
4. Add a **North-Star Metric** (one number you care about most).

**Quality check (don’t skip)**

- Can a neutral person restate your success in **one sentence with numbers**?
