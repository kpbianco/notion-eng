# Artifact 03 — Problem Statement & Value Proposition

**What this is**

A one-sentence statement of value and a short paragraph quantifying impact.

**Artifacts**

- Problem Statement
- Value Proposition (with numbers)

**How to build**

1. Paste and fill:
    
    ```
    **Problem Statement:** For <persona> who struggles with <pain>, current options <limitation>.
    **Value Proposition:** Our solution <does X> resulting in <measurable benefit> (e.g., saves <time/$>, reduces <risk> by <N%>).
    **Proof Points to Validate:**
    - PP1: <benchmark or comparison you will test>
    - PP2: ...
    
    ```
    
2. Put **numbers** to the benefit (time saved, risk reduced, cost lowered).

**Quality check**

- Can you estimate the value in **time/dollars/risk**?
