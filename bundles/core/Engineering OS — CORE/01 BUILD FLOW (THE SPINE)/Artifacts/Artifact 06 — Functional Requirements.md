# Artifact 06 — Functional Requirements

**What this is**

Numbered “system shall do X” statements you can test pass/fail.

**Artifacts**

- Functional Requirements list (FR-###)
- Acceptance notes per requirement

**How to build**

1. Notion table “Functional Requirements” with columns:
    - **ID** (FR-001…), **Statement** (“The system shall …”), **Owner**, **Priority** (Must/Should/Could), **Acceptance Test (plain)**, **Status**.
2. Write **8–15** FRs. Keep them **behavioral**, not design.

**Quality check**

- Each FR has an **acceptance test** someone can actually perform.
