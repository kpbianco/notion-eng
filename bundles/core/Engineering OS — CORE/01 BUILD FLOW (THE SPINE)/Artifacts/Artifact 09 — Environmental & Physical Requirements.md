# Artifact 09 — Environmental & Physical Requirements

**What this is**

The conditions your product must tolerate + reference tests.

**Artifacts**

- Environment Spec (with numeric ranges)
- Referenced Test Methods (standards or DIY equivalents)

**How to build**

1. Notion table “Environment Spec”: Factor (Temp/Humidity/Shock/Vibration/Ingress/EMC/etc.), Range/Level, Duration/Rate, Test Method (e.g., IEC/ISO or well-defined procedure).
2. Put **numbers** and **how** you’ll verify them (bench test, chamber, simulated loads).

**Quality check**

- Every factor has a **number** and a **test method**.
