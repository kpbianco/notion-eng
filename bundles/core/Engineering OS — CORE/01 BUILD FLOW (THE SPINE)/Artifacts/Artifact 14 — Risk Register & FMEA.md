# Artifact 14 — Risk Register & FMEA

**What this is**

A list of things that can go wrong and how you’ll prevent or contain them.

**Artifacts**

- Risk Register (project risks)
- FMEA (failure modes per subsystem/process)

**How to build**

1. **Risk Register** (Notion table):
    
    ID, Description (cause → effect), Severity (1–10), Likelihood (1–10), Detectability (1–10), **RPN = S×L×D**, Owner, Mitigation, Due, Status.
    
2. **FMEA** (per subsystem):
    
    Step/Function, Potential Failure, Effects, Causes, S/L/D, RPN, Controls (prevention/detection), Action, Owner.
    
3. Sort by **RPN**; highlight top risks.

**Quality check**

- Each high-RPN item has an **owner + mitigation + date**.
