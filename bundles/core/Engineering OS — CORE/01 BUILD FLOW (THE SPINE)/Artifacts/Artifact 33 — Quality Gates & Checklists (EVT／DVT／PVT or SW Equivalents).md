# Artifact 33 — Quality Gates & Checklists (EVT/DVT/PVT or SW Equivalents)

**What this is**

Phase gates you must pass before proceeding.

**Artifacts**

- Gate Criteria per phase
- Audit checklist

**How to build**

1. Define phases (e.g., Prototype → Beta → Release).
2. For each phase, list **gate criteria**:
    - Coverage thresholds, performance targets, defect limits, documentation completeness, security checks, compliance checks.
3. Make a **Gate Review** template:
    
    ```
    Gate: <name>  Date:
    Evidence summary (links)
    Open risks/defects
    Decision (Go/Hold) & Actions
    Approvers
    
    ```
    

**Quality check**

- You can fail a gate objectively (data decides, not vibes).
