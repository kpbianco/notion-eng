# Artifact 38 — Operational Runbook (SOPs) & SRE Basics

**What this is**

Day-to-day operations, monitoring, backups, on-call (or the hardware equivalent: handling, storage, servicing).

**Artifacts**

- Runbook
- Dashboards/Checks
- Backup & Restore Procedure
- On-call/Support rota (if applicable)

**How to build**

1. Write SOPs for:
    - Normal ops (start/stop, deploy, verify)
    - Backups (what, where, how often) + **restore test**
    - Common incidents (symptoms, diagnostic steps, fixes)
2. Link monitoring checks/dashboards.

**Quality check**

- Someone else can handle a routine issue **without calling you**.
