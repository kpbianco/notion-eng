# Artifact 27 — Development Environment & Reproducibility

**What this is**

A standard, documented dev environment you (and future you) can recreate.

**Artifacts**

- Dev Setup Guide
- Tooling manifest (container/venv/IDE)
- Sample dataset/fixtures

**How to build**

1. Page **“Dev Environment”**:
    - OS, toolchain versions, package manager commands, extensions/plugins.
2. Provide a **container or setup script** and **sample fixtures** to run basic checks.
3. Add a **“Verify setup”** section with a 60-second test command.

**Quality check**

- A new laptop can be ready and run the sample test in ≤30 minutes.
