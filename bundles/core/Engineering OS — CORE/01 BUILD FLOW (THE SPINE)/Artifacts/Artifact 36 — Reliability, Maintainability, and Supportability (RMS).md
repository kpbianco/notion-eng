# Artifact 36 — Reliability, Maintainability, and Supportability (RMS)

**What this is**

How the system behaves over time and how you fix it when it breaks.

**Artifacts**

- RMS Targets (uptime, MTBF, MTTR)
- Spares/Replacement Plan (or rollback plan for SW)
- Maintenance Schedule
- Telemetry/Health plan

**How to build**

1. Define **targets** with measurement methods.
2. Plan **maintenance** (intervals, steps, required tools/skills).
3. Document **telemetry signals** and dashboards/alerts.

**Quality check**

- You can perform a failure drill and recover within target **MTTR**.
