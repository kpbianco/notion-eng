# Artifact 05 — Glossary & Context

**What this is**

Definitions of terms/acronyms + a picture of your system’s world.

**Artifacts**

- Glossary
- System Context Diagram

**How to build**

1. **Glossary** (Notion table): Term, Plain Definition (1–2 lines), Example, Source/Link.
    - Fill 20–30 terms you’ll reuse (keep it non-jargony).
2. **Context Diagram** (text/ASCII works in Notion):
    
    ```
    [User] → uses → [Your System] → outputs → [Reports]
          ↘ interacts with ↙
            [External Service A] ←→ [External Service B]
    
    ```
    
    - Label each arrow with what flows (data/report/command) and how often.

**Quality check**

- A newcomer can read this page and correctly describe who/what interacts.
