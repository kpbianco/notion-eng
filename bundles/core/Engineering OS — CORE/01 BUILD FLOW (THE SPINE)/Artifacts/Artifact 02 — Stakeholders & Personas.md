# Artifact 02 — Stakeholders & Personas

**What this is**

Short profiles of who uses, buys, maintains, or approves the product, plus their goals and constraints.

**Artifacts to produce**

- Persona Cards
- Stakeholder Map (influence vs. interest)

**How to build**

1. Create a Notion database “Personas” with columns:
    - Name/Role, Goals, Pains, Environment/Context, Must-Haves, “Not Prioritized” (what they can live without).
2. Create **3–5 personas** (User, Buyer, Maintainer, Operator).
3. Add **one anti-persona** (who you’re explicitly *not* designing for).
4. Create a 2×2 “Stakeholder Map” table:
    - Columns: Stakeholder, Influence (Low/High), Interest (Low/High), Notes/Decision Rights.

**Quality check**

- For any tradeoff you can point to the persona that drives it.
