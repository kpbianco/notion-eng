# Artifact 15 — Risk-Kill Prototypes

**What this is**

Tiny, fast experiments to answer design-killer unknowns before you commit.

**Artifact**

- Risk-Kill Log (Question → Method → Threshold → Result → Decision)

**How to build**

1. Create a Notion database “Risk-Kills” with columns:
    - Question (uncertainty), Pass/Fail Threshold (define **before** testing), Method (what you’ll build/run), Timebox (1–4h), Result (data), Decision (Proceed/Change/Drop), Link to Evidence.
2. Run the **smallest** experiment that isolates the uncertainty.
3. Record **raw evidence** (photos, logs, quick plots).

**Quality check**

- Every design-critical assumption has a **result + decision** here.
