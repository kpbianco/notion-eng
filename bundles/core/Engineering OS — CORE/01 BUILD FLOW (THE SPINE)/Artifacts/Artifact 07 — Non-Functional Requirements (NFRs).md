# Artifact 07 — Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**What this is**

Numbers for quality attributes (speed, reliability, accuracy, etc.).

**Artifacts**

- NFR Table (targets + how to measure)
- Workload Profiles (typical/peak/worst)

**How to build**

1. Notion table “NFRs”: ID, Attribute (Latency/Throughput/Availability/etc.), **Target**, **Measurement Method**, **Environment/Load**, **Owner**.
2. Define **5–10** attributes with **numbers** (e.g., P95 latency ≤ 200 ms at 500 req/s).

**Quality check**

- Each NFR states **how** you’ll measure it and under **what load**.
