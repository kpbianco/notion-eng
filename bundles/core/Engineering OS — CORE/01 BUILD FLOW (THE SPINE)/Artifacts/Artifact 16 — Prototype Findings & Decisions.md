# Artifact 16 — Prototype Findings & Decisions

**What this is**

Summaries that turn learning into concrete design changes.

**Artifacts**

- Findings Digest
- Updated design docs (linked)

**How to build**

1. Create a Notion page “Findings Digest”.
2. For each Risk-Kill or early prototype, add:
    
    ```
    **Finding:** <What we learned, with numbers/evidence>
    **Implication:** <What this means for the design>
    **Change:** <What we will change/update – link to ICD/BOM/architecture>
    **Approved by:** <Name/date>
    
    ```
    
3. Update affected docs; add links.

**Quality check**

- No mismatch exists between this page and your latest ICD/architecture/BOM.
