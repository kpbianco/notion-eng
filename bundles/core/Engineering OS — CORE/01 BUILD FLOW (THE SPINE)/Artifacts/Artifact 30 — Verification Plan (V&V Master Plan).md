# Artifact 30 — Verification Plan (V&V Master Plan)

**What this is**

The strategy to prove requirements are met (verification) and that it’s fit for purpose (validation).

**Artifacts**

- V&V Plan
- Test Levels (unit, integration, system, acceptance)

**How to build**

1. Page **“V&V Plan”**:
    
    ```
    Scope & objectives
    Test levels & environments
    Entry/exit criteria per level
    Data management (evidence, logs, storage)
    Responsibility & schedule
    
    ```
    
2. Map tests back to **Requirements IDs** (link to §32 Traceability).

**Quality check**

- Every requirement has at least one **planned** verification method.
