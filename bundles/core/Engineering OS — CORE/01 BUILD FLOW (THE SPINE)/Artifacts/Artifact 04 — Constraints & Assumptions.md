# Artifact 04 — Constraints & Assumptions

**What this is**

Hard limits you must respect and the bets you’re making (to be validated).

**Artifacts**

- Constraint List
- Assumption Log (with owners/due dates)

**How to build**

1. Create two Notion tables:
    
    **Constraints**
    
    Columns: ID, Description, Source (law/customer/physics), Non-negotiable? (Y/N).
    
    **Assumptions**
    
    Columns: ID, Description, Why we think it’s true, Validation Method, Owner, Due Date, Status (Planned/Done/Invalid).
    
2. Fill **10 key constraints** and **top assumptions**.
3. For each assumption, write a **specific validation step** (links to Risk-Kills in §15).

**Quality check**

- Every assumption has an **owner** and **validation date**.
