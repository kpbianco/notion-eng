# Engineering OS — Business & Go-to-Market (Marketplace Draft)

### What this page is

A practical business + go‑to‑market layer that sits next to an engineering checklist.

It helps you turn a build into something people will actually buy, use, and keep—without drifting into “startup theater.” It is written so a beginner can run it.

### What this module produces (deliverables)

- A crisp **Problem/Solution Fit** statement with evidence
- A **JTBD + ICP** profile that guides engineering tradeoffs
- A **competitive map** and positioning
- A **pricing + packaging** hypothesis with validation
- A **demo + story pack** that makes technical value legible
- A lightweight **support/ops plan**
- A **shipping/returns** plan (if physical)

### How to use

Treat each section as supplemental to your build. You do not do everything at once.

You run **small experiments** (“micro‑prototypes”) that reduce the risk of building the wrong thing.

---

## 10‑Minute Quickstart (do this today)

Create a Notion page called **Go‑To‑Market Snapshot** and fill:

1. **One‑sentence value**: “Helps [who] achieve [outcome] by [mechanism] unlike [alternative].”
2. **Target user (ICP v0)**: who, context, budget reality, buying friction
3. **JTBD v0**: “When ***, I want to*** , so I can ___.”
4. **Top three risks**: (a) nobody cares, (b) pricing wrong, (c) adoption friction
5. **Rev A business goal**: “Get X qualified users to do Y and say Z”
6. **Proof asset to build next**: demo video / landing page / pilot install

If you cannot write #1, you are not ready to scale engineering scope.

---

## 1) Problem/Solution Fit

### 1.1 The only thing that matters early

**Problem/Solution Fit** is evidence that a specific group of people repeatedly experiences a specific pain and believes your approach solves it.

Not “cool product.” Not “big market.” Not “good tech.”

---

### 1.2 Define your user and the situation (context beats demographics)

**ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) v0** should include:

- Role/identity (e.g., track-day driver, shop owner, fleet manager)
- Environment constraints (vehicle, noisy shop, outdoors, regulated workplace)
- Skill level (beginner vs power user)
- Budget and purchasing mode (impulse buy vs committee)
- Tooling they already use (ecosystem)
- “Day in the life” triggers (when pain happens)

Rule: if your ICP is “anyone,” your GTM is “no one.”

---

### 1.3 JTBD (Jobs To Be Done) engineers can actually use

Write three versions per job:

- **Functional job**: what they are trying to do
- **Emotional job**: how they want to feel (confidence, control, pride)
- **Social job**: what it signals to others (competence, professionalism)

Format:

- “When I’m ***, I want to*** , so I can ___.”

Then attach:

- Current workaround
- Cost of workaround (time/money/risk)
- What breaks in workaround

This becomes your engineering prioritization anchor.

---

### 1.4 User interviews (the non-cringe method)

The goal is not “do you like it?”

The goal is: how they already solve it and what it costs them.

**Interview script (15–25 min)**

1. Walk me through the last time this happened.
2. What did you do next?
3. What tools did you use?
4. What sucked about that?
5. What would “perfect” look like?
6. What have you tried that didn’t work?
7. If this solved it, what would it be worth? Why? (Ask what they are comparing to.)

**Rules**

- No pitching in the first half.
- Get specifics: timestamps, tools, steps, screenshots if possible.
- Log exact phrases. Those become your copy.

---

### 1.5 Problem proof (how you know it’s real)

You have problem proof when:

- People describe the pain without you leading them
- They have tried multiple workarounds
- They can quantify cost (time wasted, mistakes, money, stress)
- They ask “when can I try it?”

---

### 1.6 Micro‑prototypes (Problem/Solution Fit)

**MP‑H‑PSF‑1: 10 interviews in 10 days**

Success: at least 6/10 report the same pain and can describe workaround cost.

**MP‑H‑PSF‑2: Concierge pilot (manual backend)**

You do it manually behind the scenes to prove value before engineering it.

Success: user repeats usage and says they would be upset if you removed it.

**MP‑H‑PSF‑3: Preorder/deposit test (if appropriate)**

Success: money or commitment appears without heavy persuasion.

**PSF Checklist (minimum viable)**

- [ ]  ICP v0 is narrow and real
- [ ]  10+ interviews logged with quotes
- [ ]  Top three pains ranked by frequency and severity
- [ ]  Workarounds documented with real costs
- [ ]  A must-have outcome is explicit and measurable

---

## 2) Market Sizing & Competitive Map

### 2.1 Market sizing without MBA cosplay

You need sizing for decision-making, not investor decks.

Use three layers:

- TAM: everyone who could ever use it
- SAM: people you can realistically reach
- SOM: the slice you can win in 6–18 months

Builder rule: SOM is what matters for your next release and budget.

---

### 2.2 Competitive map (what “competition” actually is)

Competition includes:

- Direct competitors
- Substitutes (spreadsheets, notebooks, generic tools)
- “Do nothing”
- Internal solutions (DIY rigs, custom scripts)

Create a table of:

- Target user
- Core promise
- Pricing model
- Key differentiators
- Adoption friction
- Where they win/lose

---

### 2.3 Positioning: category + wedge

Pick:

- Category: what box your product sits in (telemetry logger, workflow OS, etc.)
- Wedge: the smallest sharp entry point that gets adoption
- Expansion: what you add once you have users

Rule: most products fail because they try to be “the whole platform” first.

---

### 2.4 Pricing anchors (what users compare to)

People compare your price to:

- Their current workaround cost
- The cheapest acceptable alternative
- The pro tool they have heard of
- The cost of a mistake

Your job is to define the anchor and make it obvious.

---

### Micro‑prototypes (Market/Competition)

**MP‑H‑MKT‑1: Competitive teardown**

Use three competitor products for 30 minutes each.

Success: you can name five “they win here” truths and five “they lose here” truths.

**MP‑H‑MKT‑2: Landing page A/B positioning test**

Two headlines, same product.

Success: higher qualified signups/interview conversions on one positioning.

**Market/Comp Checklist**

- [ ]  SOM defined (not fantasy)
- [ ]  Top five competitors and top five substitutes documented
- [ ]  Your wedge is one clear use case
- [ ]  Pricing anchor identified
- [ ]  Positioning statement written

---

## 3) Brand & Story Pack

### 3.1 The story pack translates engineering value

Most engineers explain features. Buyers buy outcomes.

Story Pack components:

- One-liner value proposition
- Three key outcomes (not features)
- Proof points (evidence, demos, testimonials)
- “How it works” diagram
- Objection handling (price, complexity, trust)
- Demo script (5–7 minutes)

---

### 3.2 Messaging hierarchy (copy you can reuse)

- Headline: outcome + who it is for
- Subhead: how you do it + why it is different
- Three bullets: outcomes
- Proof: evidence, numbers, credibility
- Call-to-action: one step only (try/waitlist/book call)

---

### 3.3 Demo script (engineer-friendly)

A good demo is not a tour. It is a narrative:

1. Problem moment (real scenario)
2. What breaks today (workaround pain)
3. Your product solves it (one workflow)
4. Proof (data/evidence/result)
5. What happens next (CTA)

Rule: demo one killer path, not everything.

---

### Micro‑prototypes (Story)

**MP‑H‑STORY‑1: 5‑minute demo video**

Success: three strangers can explain what it does after watching.

**MP‑H‑STORY‑2: Copy test with real users**

Read headline + bullets. Ask: “What do you think this is? Who is it for?”

Success: they answer correctly without correction.

**Story Pack Checklist**

- [ ]  One-liner is clear
- [ ]  Outcomes > features
- [ ]  Proof exists (screenshots, logs, real numbers)
- [ ]  Demo script is repeatable
- [ ]  Objections answered honestly

---

## 4) Support & Ops Lite

### 4.1 Support is part of the product

Support load is a common killer of small-batch products.

Plan for:

- Onboarding
- Troubleshooting
- Updates
- Returns/replacements (if hardware)
- Feedback loop to backlog

---

### 4.2 Minimum support artifacts

- Quickstart guide (one page)
- FAQ (top 10)
- Troubleshooting decision tree
- Known issues + workarounds
- Contact method + response expectations
- Bug report template (logs + version + repro steps)

---

### 4.3 RMA loop (even at tiny volume)

Define:

- What qualifies for replacement
- Who pays shipping
- How you handle user error
- How you prevent repeats (root cause + fix)

---

### Micro‑prototypes (Support/Ops)

**MP‑H‑OPS‑1: Onboarding dry run**

Give it to a friend. No help allowed.

Success: setup under X minutes and a useful log generated.

**MP‑H‑OPS‑2: Support ticket simulation**

Write five fake tickets and see if your docs solve them.

Success: docs solve at least 3/5 without you.

**Support/Ops Checklist**

- [ ]  Onboarding is self-serve
- [ ]  Bug report template exists
- [ ]  Known issues published
- [ ]  Feedback flows into backlog with tags
- [ ]  RMA policy exists (if physical)

---

## 5) Packaging, Shipping & Returns (physical product path)

### 5.1 Packaging is engineering + cost control

Packaging must handle:

- Drops
- Vibration
- Moisture (sometimes)
- ESD (electronics)
- Labeling requirements
- Unboxing clarity

Rule: the package is part of your reliability story.

---

### 5.2 Shipping design inputs (collect before buying boxes)

- Product dimensions + weight
- Fragile points (connectors, screens)
- ESD sensitivity
- Thermal sensitivity
- Included accessories
- Unboxing steps required for safe setup

---

### 5.3 Returns policy (set expectations early)

Define:

- Return window
- Restocking fees (if any)
- Opened vs unopened policy
- Warranty duration and what it covers
- What counts as misuse

Be clear. Ambiguity becomes support burden.

---

### 5.4 Reverse logistics (tiny scale)

Even if you ship 20 units:

- Track serial numbers
- Track failure mode on returns
- Track whether failure was design vs user setup

This becomes your reliability feedback loop.

---

### Micro‑prototypes (Shipping)

**MP‑H‑SHIP‑1: Drop test packed unit**

Pack and run controlled drop tests.

Success: product survives and remains functional; packaging holds shape.

**MP‑H‑SHIP‑2: Unboxing clarity test**

Hand package to someone and watch.

Success: they do not miss critical steps; setup succeeds.

**Packaging/Shipping Checklist**

- [ ]  Packaging protects fragile areas
- [ ]  ESD precautions included if needed
- [ ]  Labeling is correct (input ratings, warnings)
- [ ]  Return/warranty policy written
- [ ]  Serial tracking exists (even a spreadsheet)
