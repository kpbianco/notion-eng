# Engineering OS — CORE + PRO bundles

## What this repo contains
This repository reorganizes the Notion “Engineering OS” export into two clean, importable wiki bundles with consistent titles and navigation.

## Bundle structure
- **CORE bundle**: `bundles/core/Engineering OS — CORE/`
- **PRO ADD-ON bundle**: `bundles/pro-addon/Engineering OS — PRO ADD-ON/`

## Import order
1. Import **CORE** first.
2. Import **PRO ADD-ON** second.

## Promise
Body content unchanged; only titles/navigation were refactored.

## Originals
All original Notion-exported Markdown files are preserved in:

- `archive/originals/`
