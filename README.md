# Engineering OS — CORE + PRO bundles

## Purpose
This repository reorganizes the Notion Engineering OS export into two importable bundles:

- **CORE**: a standalone, hobbyist-level bundle with the full foundational curriculum.
- **PRO ADD-ON**: a professional-depth add-on that imports cleanly after CORE and extends it without duplicating CORE’s top-level structure.

## Bundle structure
- **CORE bundle**: `bundles/core/Engineering OS — CORE/`
- **PRO ADD-ON bundle**: `bundles/pro-addon/Engineering OS — PRO ADD-ON/`

## Import order
1. Import **CORE** first.
2. Import **PRO ADD-ON** second.

## Guarantees
- **No content rewritten; only reorganized.**
- File contents are preserved verbatim.
- Originals are retained for traceability.

## Archive
All original Notion-exported Markdown files are preserved in:

- `archive/originals/`
